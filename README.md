- Increase users' understanding and empathy for different cultures and historical perspectives
- Create a platform for ongoing exploration and community building

## 4. Features and Functionalities
- **Human-AI Interaction**: Users can converse with AI-driven historical figures, asking questions and learning from their experiences. AI characters adapt their responses based on the user's interests and prior knowledge, offering personalized insights and engaging interactions.
- **Collaborative Exploration**: Users can invite friends or join groups with other users who share similar interests, exploring historical settings and events together. They can discuss findings, exchange ideas, and collaborate on solving puzzles or challenges related to the time period.
- **AI-Assisted Role-Playing**: Users can assume the roles of historical figures or fictional characters within the virtual environment. The AI guides users through role-playing scenarios, helping them understand the perspectives, motivations, and challenges of their chosen characters, deepening engagement and fostering empathy.
- **Social Challenges and Leaderboards**: The app introduces history-themed challenges and quizzes for users to compete in, either individually or in teams. The AI generates personalized questions and hints based on the user's performance and interests. Users can track progress on leaderboards and earn badges or rewards for their achievements.
- **Community Building**: The app includes social features such as forums or chat rooms for users to discuss their experiences, share tips, and connect with others who share their interests. AI-driven moderators facilitate positive discussions and provide additional historical context or resources.

## 5. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Specification

    participant U as User
    participant A as App
    participant S as Backend Service
    participant AI as AI Character

    U->>A: Selects historical period
    A->>S: Requests historical period data
    S-->>A: Returns historical period data
    A->>U: Displays historical environment
    U->>A: Approaches AI-driven historical figure
    A->>S: Requests AI character data
    S-->>A: Returns AI character data
    A->>U: Introduces AI character
    U->>A: Asks question to AI character
    A->>S: Sends question to AI Character
    S->>AI: Processes user's question
    AI-->>S: Returns AI character's response
    S-->>A: Returns AI character's response
    A->>U: Displays AI character's response
```

### User Story 2: A user participates in a social challenge and checks their ranking on the leaderboard

```mermaid

    U->>A: Selects social challenge
    A->>S: Requests challenge data
    S-->>A: Returns challenge data
    A->>U: Presents challenge to user
    U->>A: Completes challenge and submits answers
    A->>S: Sends user's answers
    S->>S: Evaluates user's answers
    S-->>A: Returns challenge results
    A->>U: Displays challenge results
    U->>A: Requests leaderboard
    A->>S: Requests leaderboard data
    S-->>A: Returns leaderboard data
    A->>U: Displays leaderboard with user's ranking
```

## 7. Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Unity**: A popular game engine that supports VR development and provides a rich ecosystem of tools, plugins, and assets. Unity will be used to create the virtual environments, user interface, and interactions in TimeSilkRoad.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A scalable and efficient JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, suitable for handling the server-side logic and real-time communication required for TimeSilkRoad.
- **Express**: A lightweight and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web APIs and handling HTTP requests.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system that can handle complex data structures and relationships. PostgreSQL will be used to store user data, historical content, and AI-generated narratives.
- **Redis**: A fast, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a cache, message broker, or temporary storage. Redis can be employed to store frequently accessed data, such as leaderboards and session information, for quick retrieval.

### AI and Natural Language Processing
- **OpenAI API**: To power the AI-driven historical characters and generate personalized responses, the OpenAI API can be used. OpenAI's GPT models excel at understanding context and generating human-like text, making them a great fit for creating engaging and interactive AI characters in TimeSilkRoad.

### VR Compatibility
- **SteamVR or Oculus SDK**: Depending on the target VR platforms (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or others), appropriate SDKs will be integrated into the Unity project to ensure compatibility and smooth performance across devices.

### Hosting and Infrastructure
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** or **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Both platforms offer a wide range of services for hosting, scaling, and managing backend infrastructure, as well as tools for monitoring and securing the application. You can choose the one that best fits your preferences and requirements.
